          Software engineers apply principles and techniques from computer science, engineering and mathematical analysis to specify, design, implement, evaluate, and maintain software systems. The bachelor of science in software engineering prepares students for a wide range of careers in the computing fields, as well as related positions in other domains, such as healthcare, finance, and communications.

          Programming skills are only one of the many components of a successful graduate of the Quinnipiac software engineering program. Students also acquire requirement specification, design, quality assurance and project management skills. Problem solving in teams through effective use of oral and written communication is also emphasized in the program. Students specify, design, and implement non-trivial software systems and complete a two-semester capstone project. Each student is required to obtain professional experience (e.g., through an internship or a research project) prior to graduation, which is facilitated by the program's collaboration with industrial and academic partners.
